				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p class="description">
					As a practice for testing the usability of a website 
					(in our case, target.com) and the effectiveness of the System Usability Scale (SUS),
					I created a number of tasks that a person relatively unacquainted with the website would perform.
					I then measured how long it took the user to find these pages as well as the number of clicks required, and recorded my observations.

				<h3>Task 1: Find the Phone Number of the Closest Target Store to You</h3>
				<p>Took just 3 seconds and one click since the closest Target store was auto-selected. The user was successful, and this was the easiest one of all of the tasks. Target even had other nearby stores listed on the page, so it would have been very easy to see the phone number of all nearby stores.</p>

				<h3>Task 4: Look at Target's Career Opportunities</h3>
				<p>Gave up after 1m and 15s, easy to find career page but job search didn’t work after the use of various keywords. Task was unsuccessful, it was very difficult to find a list of the jobs one was actually looking for. 
				It is possible that the search was coming up with no results because all job postings were taken, but then the website should say that instead of giving an error involving an incorrect keyword (See below). Was easy to find career section of website, with button listed at bottom of page. Of note, I didn’t have this same error on my computer, but for some reason the search was broken when the subject tried it.</p>

				<h3>Task 5: Find Clothes on Clearance</h3>
				<p>Took 30s and only 3 clicks, but found any clothes on sale instead of specifically clearance deals. So, partial success?
					 In any case, subject navigated to Categories instead of Deals at the top of the page, meaning that once the user made it to the clothes section, the only way to filter from there was by “Deals” and not “Clearance”.

			<p class="description">
				For target.com, I would allow the user to filter products by clearance. This allows users to find better deals easier on their website. In addition, the weakest point of the website was the careers section. 
				Although potentially less important than wow-ing customers, the fact that it was so frustrating for Evie to try to find a career is an important note that the website should fix. 
				To fix this, I would fix the errors that the keyword search gave, or simply remove the keyword search altogether and show all job postings at a provided Target location.
